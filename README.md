# The Pizza Challenge
### Problem Statement
Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey, has been collecting data on its sales for the past year but hasn't used it to improve how the restaurant runs or to increase sales. As a Business Intelligence Consultant, my job is to analyze this data and find ways to help the restaurant operate better and make more money. Specifically, we want to answer these questions:
1.	What days and times are the restaurant's busiest?
2.	How many pizzas are made during these busy times?
3.	What are the most popular and least popular pizzas?
I'll also look for other ways to improve the restaurant's operations and sales. To present these findings, I've created a Power BI dashboard to make the data easy to understand and use for decision-making.

### Sections in Dashboard
* Monthly Sales and Quantity: Displays monthly trends in revenue (y-axis) and quantity sold (secondary y-axis) with months on the x-axis.
* KPIs: Highlights total revenue and quantity sold as key performance indicators.
* Day-wise Sales: Shows revenue (y-axis) across days of the week (x-axis).
* Category-wise Sales and Quantity: Compares pizza categories (x-axis) with revenue (y-axis as bars) and quantity sold (y-axis as a line).
* Hour-wise Sales: Displays revenue (y-axis) trends by hours of the day (x-axis).
* Size-wise Sales: Illustrates sales distribution by pizza size in a pie chart.
* Quarter Slicer: Acts as a filter to analyze data by quarters.

### Answer to the Questions
1.	What days and times are the restaurant's busiest?
* Day: Fridays have the highest revenue, indicating they are the busiest.
* Time: Peak sales occur around 12 noon, suggesting this is the busiest hour.

2.	How many pizzas are made during these busy times?
* Day: 8242 pizzas were made with a revenue of 136k during Friday.
* Time: 6776 pizzas were made with a revenue of 112k at 12 noon.

3.	What are the most popular and least popular pizzas?
* Best-selling: Classic pizzas generate the highest revenue and quantity.
* Worst-selling: Veggie pizzas have the lowest revenue and chicken pizza has the lowest quantity.
